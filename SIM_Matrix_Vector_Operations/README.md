# SIM_Matrix_Vector_Operations

This repository contains my completed Day 1 assignment for the **Simulation and Modeling Lab (CSE 413)** at Level 4, Term 1.

## ğŸ“˜ Task Overview

The objective of this task was to practice Python-based matrix and vector operations using NumPy and apply various mathematical functions. Below is a summary of the components:

### âœ… Completed Sections

1. **Scalar & Array Operations**
   - Applied trigonometric functions on a 1D array with scalar multiplication.

2. **Matrix Operations**
   - Operations on a custom 3Ã—2 matrix:
     - Trigonometric
     - Exponential & Logarithmic
     - Absolute & Square Root
     - Modulo, Rounding

3. **Vector Functions**
   - Max, Min with indices
   - Vector length
   - Sorted matrix (row-wise & overall)
   - Sum, Product
   - Median, Mean, Standard Deviation

4. **Bonus**
   - Heatmap visualization with `seaborn` (if done)
   - Random matrix generation using `numpy.random`
